                    I wanted to see if loss aversion is playing an effect in world cup penalties shoot-outs. I explain what loss aversion is fully and what I did to test if it was present in the blog post linked above. The short summary is that I was testing to see if the outcome of a kick was influenced by the preceding kick. There was a measured difference but it wasn’t significant.

                    I using the Python libraries Beautiful Soup and Pandas to scrape the data from Wikipedia and then wrangled it. For the hypothesis test I used a Chi-Squared test as this was categorical data.

                    I used <a href="http://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/" target="_blank">data</a> from the World Health Organisation to compare if UK air pollution was still better than China's. It may seem obvious that the UK's would be better but I had been reading in the news that the UK government has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/high-court-rules-uk-air-pollution-plans-unlawful" target="_blank">lost three court cases</a> over how bad it's air pollution plans are. Meanwhile China has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-11/china-is-winning-its-war-on-air-pollution-at-least-in-beijing" target="_blank">receiving praise</a> for the improvements it's been making so I wanted to check if the UK was still ahead. Unfortunately data was only available between 2013 to '16 but it was still possible to create an interesting story.

                    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of red wine data set with R for the EDA section of the Data Analyst Nanodegree on Udacity. This was my first time using R and the course that built up to this project is available for free <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651" target="_blank">here</a>. It goes through how to use R and R studio as well as what EDA is. The only difference between the free course and Nanodegree version is that you won't be assigned this project at the end. However if you do want to do the project the source data is available on my GitHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It follows the structure of univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis with a summary of findings or points or interest at the end of each section. There's then a final plots and conclusion section with 3 of the plots from the analysis polished up to look more presentable. Can you guess what the variable with the highest correlation to the wine's rating out of 10 was? ...It was, of course, alcohol content! Higher alcohol percentages had a positive relationship with higher ratings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was really surprised how much I liked R. Before this I'd thought it was just something used by academics who hadn't got with the times and learned Python yet. I still think Python is better for working with data but R and its ggplot2 library are actually great for creating graphs. I thought it was much easier to build up complex, multi-layered plots than it would be in Python and its graphing library Matplotlib.

The programming includes if statments, for loops and functions.

                <p><a href="dand_certificate.pdf" target="_blank">My certificate</a> for completing the course.</p>
                <p>I did term 2 of this course on Udacity which had three sections:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Exploratory data analysis with R (<a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651" target="_blank">course available free here</a>)</li>
                      <li>Data wrangling with Python and the Pandas library</li>
                      <li>Data visualisation with Tableau (<a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-in-tableau--ud1006" target="_blank">course available free here</a>)</li>
                    </ol>
                    It was the first course I did on Udacity and I was very impressed with it. It's delivered mainly through numerous short video lectures which are typically only 2-3 minutes long and normally have an exercise to do during or at the end of each video. It was a lot more expensive than courses I've done before at £579. A lot of the content is available free, as linked above. The advantage of the paid version is at the end of each section has a relatively large project to do that gets graded. As well as the benefit of doing a project yourself this also means you have something to show off your work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this course I've found I needed to brush up on a lot of things so have also done additional smaller courses on <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775" target="_blank">using Git for version control</a> (which I now use for the files of this website), <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595" target="_blank">Linux command line basics</a> to help with using Git, intros to <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827" target="_blank">descriptive</a> and <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201" target="_blank">inferential</a> statistics (which I flicked through to refamiliarise myself on statistics terms), and an intro to the Python <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170" target="_blank">Pandas library</a> which I'd used before but never fully understood.

                <h5>Projects</h5>
                <p>
                    The was a project at the end of each section. They're detailed better in the main Projects section of this site but in summary were <a href="redwine_eda/index.html" target="_blank">explorative data analysis</a> on a red wine data set, <a href="data_wrangling_weratedogs/jupyter_full.html" target="_blank">gathering and cleaning data</a> from the WeRateDogs twitter profile and <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/mark.macardle#!/vizhome/UKvChinaAirPollution_final/Story1" target="_blank">visualising the differences between UK and China's air pollution</a> in big cities.

                <h5>Time Taken</h5>
                <p>
                    Not including some of the extra courses I did it took 106 hours in total. The first, second and third section took 45, 43.5, and 17.5 hours respectively. The projects took 17, 21.5 and 10.5 hours respectively. So the final section on data visualisation was much shorter than the other two.

                <p>Course used SQL in PostGres with pgAdmin and was provided on Udemy. It started with basic queries of a database to select and view columns before moving on to more advanced with conditional queries and topics like joining or self-joining tables. It also covered setting up new databases and creating and modifying tables. I feel like it ended a little too soon as the creating tables section seemed to leave out how to use foreign keys in different tables. 
                </p>
                <p>Overall though it was an enjoyable and clear course. It was thought by the same tutor as the "Python Bootcamp" course I'd previously done, which I also enjoyed.
                </p>
                <h5>Projects</h5>
                <p>The assessments and challenges were on querying databases of a DVD rental store social club. Both had multiple tables that you sometimes had to join to properly query. In the final section you had to create your own database with teacher and student tables, define the data types and insert rows of information.
                </p>
                <p>While the activities were frequent through the course they were all quite brief. This is a common criticism I have of Udemy courses as it's hard to know much you can do on your own without challenges that need significant amount of independent work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Time Taken</h5>
                <p>This was likely the shortest course I've done. It had 8.5 hours of video but only took 15 hours for me to get through, which is largely due to the short activities.

                <p>This was the first course I’ve done on Coursera. It was created by Stanford University which is famous for computer science and for a huge amount of its students going on to work at the major tech companies. The lecturer is Andrew Ng who himself is a famous for advances his teams have made in machine learning. This course is a shortened version of what they teach on campus (which is 
                <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/course/machine-learning/id495053006" target="_blank">available for free</a>
                too). Also if you google or search on Quora for how to learn machine learning you’ll very likely see this recommended.
                </p>
                <p>With all that credibility and popularity I had pretty high expectations. I did really enjoy this course and found it fascinating, but the thing that no one seemed to bother mentioning on Quora is that it’s mainly about <i>the theory</i> of machine learning, rather than applying it. This means enough mathematical notation to suffocate a tall elephant and any programming is done in Matlab (or the free equivalent Octave). There’s an optional brush up section at the start on linear algebra that I recommend because matrices and their multiplication feature heavily.
                </p>
                <p>The course content is almost the opposite of the Data Science course I did previously on Udemy. That was all about how to apply it and showing the code you’d use in Python, this was about how the algorithms behind it all worked. If this was the first thing I tried to do in machine learning I probably would have run away, but after the other course this was actually really interesting to see how it all worked.
                </p>
                <h5>Projects</h5>
                <p>It has 8 projects that took me 4 to 5 hours to complete each week. They’re in Matlab and involve finishing functions to get a program they’ve written to work. While they were good for increasing my understanding of the material, it suffers a similar problem to the Data Science course. Now that I’ve finished it I’m not much better at applying machine learning independently, despite understanding it better. Like the Data Science course to make the most of it you’ll have to independently find some project to work on to apply your learning. I found 
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle’s</a> initial challenges like the Titanic data set great for this.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Time Taken</h5>
                <p>I’m not sure how many hours of video lectures there are but it took me 82 hours over 10 weeks overall to complete. Unlike the Udemy courses this is broken down to have a weekly structure with one assignment and a multiple choice test or two to complete each week. You’ll get reminders to complete the assignments on time. There’s actually no penalty for submitting late but I found the structure helpful anyway as it encouraged me to stay on track.

                <p>I did this course on Udemy and it is my favourite so far. I feel like I’ve gained a really good (or at least vastly improved) understanding of Python and was able to apply it by creating a two player version of Snake (check it out <a href="https://github.com/markmacardle/Snake-1_and_2_player" target="_blank">on my GitHub</a>
                ). It covered data structures and object orientated programming. The data structures content, like working with lists and strings, is exactly what you need to know for code challenges and HackerRank questions. I don’t really have anything negative to say about it.
                </p>
                <h5>Projects</h5>
                <p>There's three milestone projects as you work through the course. A text based tic-tac-toe game after you've learnt about logic and loops. A text based blackjack game after learning about functions and classes and then after some more work you're directed to choose your own project that will take about a week. He does give some ideas to help with choosing. I chose to do a <a href="https://github.com/markmacardle/Snake-1_and_2_player" target="_blank">two player version of Snake</a>
                as I wanted to practice using classes more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Time Taken</h5>
                <p>The course has around 12 hours of videos and it took me 84 hours over 9 weeks to complete. I’d say I spent half of that time or more on the projects.

                <p>I found this course really interesting and got through it pretty quickly. It goes through and demonstrates the most common machine learning techniques using Python in Enthought Canopy. The lecturer, Frank Kane, has interesting experience having worked for IMDB and is engaging to listen to. His explanations of how the different algorithms work are clear and concise and he doesn’t get bogged down in the maths behind it all. The format of the lectures is typically a few slides on how an algorithm works and then talking through an IPython notebook where he'll demo what each part of the code does.
                </p>
                <h5>Projects</h5>
                <p>Maybe his lack of teaching experience shows here as I felt the assignments were the weak part of this course. There are frequent "activities," but there are mainly change the variables in code he has written and see the effect on the result. This doesn't give you great experience as a writing the code the get to the stage where you apply the algorithm is actually a pretty big part of it. Possibly if I'd been better at Python at the time I wouldn't have considered it such an issue.
                </p>
                <p>That doesn't mean the course was a waste, just that to make the most of it you’ll just need to find some projects that will let you practice independently applying your learning. I found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle’s</a> initial challenges like the Titanic data set great for this.
                </p>

                <h5>Time Taken</h5>
                <p>It’s a fairly short course with about about 9 hours of video content and with the lack of independent work to do means you can get though it quickly. It took me 41 hours over 9 weeks to complete. I did spend a good few of those hours trying to unsuccessfully create that recommender engine though!

                <p>This was the first course I did and it’s also the only one I haven’t actually finished it (I’m at 75%!). It’s one of the most popular courses on Udemy and definitely covers a lot of material for full stack web development. It does what it says on the tin and covers html, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and to what I felt was a less thorough extent, PHP and MySQL. There's also a Python bit that I haven't got to yet. It’s from Rob Percival who has some of the most popular courses on Udemy. It’s well structured with a lot of assignments to implement your learning by creating your own web pages. 
                </p>
                One criticism I have of this course is that I feel a bit of detail on data structures of different languages is passed over. For example in the JavaScript section arrays are introduced as a way to store a list of values, but the fact there are other ways to store values or that they have different performance when being searched isn't.
                </p>
                <h5>Projects</h5>
                <p>Despite skipping over a some of the detail the projects you do are impressive. For example see some of web pages I made in the Projects section, like the JSbin clone. The focus on projects is definitely a highlight of the course and gives a real sense of accomplishment. Every section has a project at the end to create a web page with what you've learned. Also during the videos he continuously prompts you to pause and try what he's been demonstrating. You could do this anyway but his persistence helps stop lasyness getting the better of you. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Time Taken</h5>
                <p>When I was doing this course I hadn't started recording the amount of hours I was spending on programming so I don’t have an exact figure for what it took me. It's a long course with about 30 hours of video content. Relating that to the Python course I did, in which I think I spent a similar proportion of time on projects, and I’d say I’ve spent about 150 hours on it.

                    So far the websites I've used for my courses are <a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. I’ve found them all good but with some differences between them which I discuss below. This is just based on my own experiences with them so isn't definitive and your experience may vary!
                </p>
                <br>

                <h5><a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a></h5>
                <p>
                    I feel the courses on Udemy were to most focused on getting something to show for your work. The courses are normally by professionals who have good industry experience but they may not have taught before. For example the data science with Python course I did had good content and was very focused on what’s asked for in job ads. But it didn’t have many projects you had to do independently so I struggled to apply what I’d learnt afterwards. That said there can be a lot of variation between courses and I thought the Python Bootcamp or Complete Web Developer courses I did were examples of well structured courses with good practical exercises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The courses vary in length but the bulk seem to have about 20 hours of video lectures. These are normally broken down into 5 to 10 minute videos focusing on particular issues so you could hope through the courses to get to what you want.
                </p>
                <p><u>Costs</u>
                    <br>
                    They advertise courses for around £200 but have near-perpetual sales so I haven’t paid more than £15. They’ll always say the sale is just about to end, but really it’ll be back on sale in a few days so don’t fell rushed into purchases. A tip I've found is to download the Udemy app before you buy a course. On more than one occasion when on a computer the Udemy website will advertise a course to me for £15, but when I check the same course on the app it will be £10. Now I purchase my courses using the app and do them on my laptop.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h5><a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a></h5>
                <p>
                    On Coursera the courses are from universities and delivered by lecturers so they have great teaching experience but are more academic. The machine learning course also had good content but also had programming assignments each week that took me around 4-5 hours to do and definitely increased my understanding of the material. The downside was the material was quite theoretical and those assignments were in Matlab, a language popular in academia but not industry. I think (like my memories of actual university) they can focus too much on the theory and not enough in applying it in the real world.
                </p>
                <p><u>Costs</u>
                    <br>
                    I've found Coursera's costs to be quite changeable so you'll have to check their website for the latest. When I first looked at a course in 2015 all the courses were free and they sold upgrades like a cert for your LinkedIn profile. When I did my second course in July 2017 (on machine learning, detailed in its own post) each University seemed to have a few entry level courses for free and then charge for the advanced material.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h5><a href="https://udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a> (My new favourite!)</h5>
                <p>
                    I think Udacity is better than both Udemy and Coursera by having the best balance of a well structured course that covers the relevant theory but also covers applying it in the real world. Their videos also have the highest productiton quality I've seen so far and often pause midway to get you to do small exercises which helps make them engaging.
                </p>
                <p><u>Costs and Course Types</u>
                    <br>
                    Udacity are by far the most expensive but their mission is to "democratize education" so they have a lot of content in <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/courses/all" target="_blank">their catalogue</a> which is free for anyone to view. I don't think all the latest videos are there but the most are. For instance of the 3 sections of the Data Analyst Nanodegree I did two of the video courses are available for free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second way is by paying for their "Nanodegree" courses, which cover a few courses within them (see my post on the Data Analyst one for more detail). I paid £579 for term 2 of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Term 2 and generally the Nanodegrees seem to be between £300 to £600. I've noticed the prices vary seasonally. There were discounts being offered last summer, then none at the end of the year and start of a new year. Now in May I see some courses getting discounted again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For all this money the extras you get over the free courses is that you have assignments to do, which are actually graded by a human, and a deadline to finish them by as well as help with CVs and interview practice. I've only been interested in the assignments so far and found them really useful. They've taken about 20 hours to do and are structured to end up with something presentable at the end. Hence they are very good for having something tangible to show for you efforts or discuss in an interview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fact they're graded by a human wasn't that big a deal to me. The assignment requirements are normally quite specific so you can tell if you've met them before you submit. If they do send you back corrections though they are helpful in describing the issue and how to approach it better. 
                </p>
                <p><u>Are The Paid Courses Worth It?</u>
                    <br>
                    For me, yes. You definitely could save the money just doing the free courses and find some data sets to do projects on. However I've found it very hard to know where to start when doing that. Also motivating yourself to do a project when there's no time pressure and getting that project to a high and presentable level when there's no requirements is hard! This is also my hobby and I really enjoy doing these courses which makes it a lot easier to be comfortable spending the money.
